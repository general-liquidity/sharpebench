//! The language-agnostic agent ⇄ harness protocol.
//!
//! Agents are **external** — a container or HTTP endpoint, in any language — not
//! Rust code. Each decision step the harness sends a [`MarketObservation`] (JSON)
//! and the agent replies with a [`Decision`] (JSON). Keeping this surface tiny and
//! stable is what lets any vendor compete (and is the whole adoption story).
//!
//! All observations are **point-in-time**: `close_history`, `fundamentals` and
//! `news` only ever contain information available at or before `date`.
